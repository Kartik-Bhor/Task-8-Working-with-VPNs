# Task-8-Working-with-VPNs

VPN Setup and Analysis Report

1. VPN Selection and Registration
A reputable free VPN service, such as ProtonVPN, was chosen due to its no-logs policy, transparent privacy practices, and unlimited bandwidth on its free plan. An account was created using an email address to complete the sign-up process.

2. Download and Installation
The ProtonVPN client was downloaded from the official website and installed on a Windows system. The installation process was straightforward, requiring standard permissions.

3. Connecting to a VPN Server
Upon launching the VPN client, a list of available servers was presented. A nearby server (India or Singapore, depending on speed) was selected to ensure minimal latency. The connection was established successfully.

4. IP Address Verification
To confirm that the VPN was active, the website whatismyipaddress.com was used before and after the VPN connection. Initially, the IP address showed the user's actual location. After connecting, it reflected the VPN server's location, indicating that the IP address had successfully changed.

5. Browsing with VPN
A few secure websites (https://example.com, https://bbc.com) were visited to confirm traffic encryption. The browser indicated HTTPS connections, and content loaded normally, suggesting secure and encrypted data transmission via the VPN tunnel.

6. Speed and IP Comparison
After disconnecting the VPN, the IP address reverted to the original ISP-provided address. A speed test comparison (using speedtest.net) showed that the browsing speed was slightly slower when using the VPN, which is expected due to encryption overhead and routing through an external server.

7. Research on VPN Encryption and Privacy
ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption with OpenVPN and WireGuard protocolsâ€”considered industry standards for secure VPN communication. The service adheres to a strict no-logs policy and is based in Switzerland, which has strong privacy laws. The VPN does not track browsing history or sell data to third parties.

8. Summary: Benefits and Limitations of VPNs

Benefits:

Enhanced Privacy: Hides real IP address and prevents websites from tracking user location.

Secure Communication: Encrypts internet traffic, especially useful on public Wi-Fi.

Bypass Censorship: Allows access to content restricted in certain regions.

Anonymity: Reduces digital footprint by masking identity online.


Limitations:

Reduced Speed: Encryption and server distance may slow down internet speeds.

Limited Access in Free Plans: Fewer server options and speed throttling in free versions.

Trust Dependency: Users must trust the VPN provider to not log or misuse data.

Blocked Content: Some streaming services block VPN IP ranges, making access difficult.
